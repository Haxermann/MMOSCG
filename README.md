            <p>â€œEducation is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world." Nelson Mandela</p>
            
            <p> Before the start of the civil war in March 2011, Syria was a country that was capable of providing for its people, with a rate of school enrollment of almost 100%. Nowadays, due to armed groups targeting schools, schoolchildren, and teachers as military strategy, there are almost 2.8 million children out of school.** </p>

             <p> The purpose of our app is to give the possibility for Syrian children, teenagers and adults to whom teaching was made impossible due to war to continue with their education, and develop their skills, while they are at home or, for example, in a foreign country. They will have the possibility to get the same subjects they were going to be taught at their own schools, and the app is developed so it adapts to the users own level of knowledge. In this way, they will be provided the correct level of dificulty and be challenged accordingly, to encourage our users to continue using the app until they fulfill the course.
